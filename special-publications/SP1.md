Any Draft Specification which targets this Working Committee and which has been properly revised, may be approved by a Majority Vote.

Members should object to merging newly revised copies only for the following reasons:
* That any copyright, patent, or trademark notice, license or grant required is missing or unacceptable to the Working Committee or to the LCS Project,
* That the Publication has either content or subject matter which violates either the LCS Project or Working Committee Code of Conduct,

### §7.1 Review Process for in-progress Draft Publications and Special Publications

The Members of the Working Committee, in using their own knowledge and expertise in the subject-matter of the specification and the purview of the Working Committee, should address the following questions in review of any Draft Publication or Draft Special Publication:
1. Whether or not the specification being established is correct or has issues that require addressing,
2. Whether or not the specification addresses all desireable constraints on uses of the specification, 
3. Whether or not the specification avoids unnecessarily placing undesireable constraints on uses of the specification,
4. How the specification addresses evolution, or defers additional details or constraints, and whether such evolution is handled in an appropriate manner, and
5. Any other questions they may consider answering while undertaking such review.
